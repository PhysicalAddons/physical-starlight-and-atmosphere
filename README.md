## About Physical Starlight and Atmosphere
"Physical Starlight and Atmosphere" is a full environmental simulator that takes inspiration from 'sandbox' game worlds and editors, bringing visual consistency between every object in the scene.

Apart from our Sun, this addon can simulate any other star. The sky is not only a static skydome but the whole atmosphere - from the ground to space and beyond. Calculations are based on the physical properties of how light is interacting with the gaseous medium. This is why I did not name it "Real Sunlight and Sky".
